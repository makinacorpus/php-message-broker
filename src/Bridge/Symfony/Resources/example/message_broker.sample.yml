message_broker:
    #
    # Each consumer consumes from one or more queues.
    #
    # Key in the following array are abitrary names, values are array of queue
    # names.
    #
    # In order to fetch the proper consumer for a task, use the ConsumerRegistry
    # interface, all services will be registered to it.
    #
    # If you leave this empty (i.e. you don't define it) as single "default"
    # named consumer will be created, which will consume everything from the
    # "default" queue.
    #
    # In real life, you would have a single queue per consumer, but since this
    # will be used in monolic applications, you can therefore plug runners that
    # consume messages from more than one queues, hence the array here.
    #
    consumers:
        default: default
        cron: ["tasks", "cron", "some_other_queue"]
